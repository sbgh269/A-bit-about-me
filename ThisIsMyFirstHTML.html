<h1>A Bit A Bout A Ben</h1>
<h3>Here are a few interesting critters that I have met while diving</h3>
<hr />
<h2>the blue ring octopus, the mimic octopus, the flamboyant cuttlefish, the ,andarin fish, the thresher shark, and a friendly and very curious honu</h2>
<h3>Here are some species and events that I hope to observe while diving</h3>
<hr />
<h2>A jumping mobula ray migration event, a chambered nautilus, and any whale </h2>
<p>I could write paragraph upon paragraph about why diving is so wonderful but I wont<br />...because that would take too long.</p>

<pre>Suffice it to say, life on land &lt; the silent world under the surface of the waves. Though just being near the ocean or anywhere in nature is generally &gt; being inside as far as Iâ€™m concerned. </pre>

<span>In closing</span>
<span>Ill just say</span>
<span>I</span>
<span>love</span>
<span>the ocean, and I dont know why my font changed.</span>
